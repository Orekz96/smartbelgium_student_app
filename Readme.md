SmartBelgium: A Travel & Adaptation Guide for International Students

Overview:
As an international student at KU Leuven, I experienced firsthand the confusion of arriving in a new country. So I am building SmartBelgium — a full-stack web app that helps students settle into Belgium by offering interactive maps, student-contributed tips, and localized advice on housing, SIM cards, public transport, and more.

Intended Key Features:
🗺️ Interactive Leaflet Map with markers for key student services
🌐 Multilingual UI (English, French, Dutch)
🧠 Smart Onboarding that tailors recommendations by city
📝 Verified user-contributed tips and local hacks
🔐 Secure authentication and personal dashboards
🧳 Weekend Planner with affordable trip ideas across Belgium

Intended Tech Stack:
Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS, Leaflet.js
Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB Atlas
Auth: JWT, Google OAuth
Deployment: Vercel (Frontend), Railway (Backend)

Outcome:
This project reflects my ability to design and implement a full-stack application grounded in real-life challenges. It merges technical proficiency with empathy-driven design — values shaped by my background in philosophy.
